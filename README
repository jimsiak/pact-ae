This artifact contains the necessary source code and complementary scripts to
allow the reproduction of the experimental section of our paper:
"RCU-HTM: Combining RCU with HTM to Implement Highly Efficient Concurrent Binary Search Trees"
that has been accepted to PACT'17.

To compile the source code and reproduce our experimental evaluation give the following commands:
$ git clone https://github.com/rcu-htm/pact-ae.git
$ cd pact-ae
$ make
$ source ./scripts/source_me.sh
$ ./scripts/run.sh

The results are placed in a newly created directory inside the results dir. The name of the directory
consists of the date and the hostname of the machine on which the commands were executed,
e.g., results/2017_06_12-15_06-node1.

We also provide two scripts that can be used to produce figures similar to Figures 11 and 12 of the
paper. The following commands will produce the appropriate image files in the scripts/plots directory:
$ cd ./scripts
$ source source_me.sh
$ ./create-figure-11-plots.sh ../results/2017_06_12-15_06-node1
$ ./create-figure-12-plots.sh ../results/2017_06_12-15_06-node1 22

where the second argument of create-figure-12-plots.sh is the number of threads to which the specific
plots refer to.
